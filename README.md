1. Ask the user for two users' ages, and indicate who is older; behave differently if both are over
100.

2. Implement a simple "password" system that takes a password in the form of a number. Make it
so that either of two numbers are valid, but use only one if statement to do the check.

3. Write a small calculator that takes as input one of the four arithmetic operations, the two
arguments to those operations, and then prints out the result

4. Expand the password checking program from earlier in this chapter and make it take multiple
usernames, each with their own password, and ensure that the right username is used for the
right password. Provide the ability to prompt user's again if the first login attempt failed. Think
about how easy (or hard) it is to do this for a lot of usernames and passwords.
